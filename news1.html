"I'm concerned we'd be dismissive of the possibility of allowing people to come to our province because there are a lot of other people who have COVID when they don't. I'd be concerned about that," Pallister said Tuesday. </p>
<p>
"I think as long as the precautionary measures and the self-isolation periods and the other recommendations of our health officer are respected and followed, then I think we're not in an unreasonable position to offer relative safety. And in offering relative safety, if we can then advance our economy and social lives, then that's a good thing."</p>

<p>The league hasn't started its 2020 season, but has said a hub-city possibility is one option for a shortened campaign.</p>

<p>Winnipeg and Regina have been mentioned as hub-city possibilities.</p>

<p>The earliest an abbreviated '20 season will begin is September, but CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie has stated a cancelled campaign also remains possible.
